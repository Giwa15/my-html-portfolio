<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mariam. I am a iniquisitive, I love learning new things and travelling</p>

<p>I had an bachelors degree in biochemistry and Masters in pharmaceutical chemistry
   when I was in Nigeria. I started learning programming december 2022. It was not 
    rosy experience due to language barrier. My finnish language skills improved with
     time and the classes made more sense.</p>

<p>I choose programming because it entails continous learning. One has to unlearn and 
  relearn new things always. I also love the creative and logical thinking aspect.</p>
